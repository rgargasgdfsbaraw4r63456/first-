      <h3>16 April 2023🌲 - The day I Started Having feelings For YOU</h3>
      <p>Maybe You don't remember the day from my point of view so let me break it down real quick just to remind you how i started feeling for you ; As we had diffent crowd surrounded i felt to be with you , we sat together leaving everyone behind , i still remember how awakard it was for me so for a change i started clicking pictures of us . The moment you leaned on me (for a photo obv) butterflies or say dragonflies were flying down there . yet i was so tough . later when that mutual friend told us to come closer for a photo i knew i had to pull you in so i grabbed your arm and pulled you in and that was the best part of holding you with me , ever since everytime we went out i always felt like holding your hand ; for a reason i used to convince everyone for HORROR movies tho , hehe .</p>

      <h3>23 October 2023🍿-First ever Date we had and so far the BEST day.</h3>
      <p> I cabbed us Together , first awakard then holding hands , talking goofy and stuff . That was the first day we went out , i remember you felt like you were not dressed that good but istg just after knowing your outfit i went straight to buy something that matched with you , eventually i found something. But i did not tell you that because you were already excited about the coincidence that happened ; you thought we matched by coincidence how funny was that yet cute right. </p>
      <p>Movie started , us holding hands waiting for the light to go off was the cutest thing. staring at each other with all the love we had from the start , before interval we went down the stairs and i still remember your breath when we kissed , one time, two times, third time and now i was scared of getting caught , you called me again and we kissed like 4th time for 5 seconds and that was the best feeling a person could have. The face you made when you blushed will always be my favorite , that was the most natural thing I saw of yours , I loved you back then and I still do . </p>

  <h2>A Letter For You</h2>
  <div class="letter-box">
    <p><strong>May 27 →</strong></p>
    <p>As I am writing this, I am deeply sad... and being someone who can’t live one moment without you, being away is something I could never have imagined. It’s so crazy.But I understand things will be good and i know every reason of whats happpening.</p>
    <p>We fight a lot even on silliest stuff. But I trust that we can overcome this test presented to us — and I <em>truly</em> believe that. Distance won’t change what we have. It might keep us apart physically, but our hearts are still intertwined.</p>
    <p>We’ll manage through the silence, the time zones, the waiting... because love like this doesn’t fade — it grows stronger. yeah maybe you wont feel like doing so but i will always choose you and come for you when you are lost in the strangest way possible .</p>
    <p>We’ll share laughter in voice notes, hugs through texts, and hope in each call. No matter the distance, you’ll always be my closest person.</p>
    <p>We make it out — and I will be the happiest person when we meet again.</p>
    <p> Don't make or think it as a long distance but we actually are , for me a month feels heavy not meeting you and i know we both try our best to meet but destiny keeps us apart somehow , when we meet - I’ll be yours . Stay safe and stay calm . Rohaneet is always with you .</p>
    <p><strong>I LOVE YOU A LOT, MALLIKA.</strong></p>
